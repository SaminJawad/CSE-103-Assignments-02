# CSE-103-Assignments-02

Solutions of some intermediate arithmetic problem given as assignments in structured programming (CSE 103) by C.

# if...else Problem Solving 
This repository contains the solutions to some if...else problems, created as part of my CSE 103 assignments. Each program demonstrates fundamental concepts in C programming, such as using operators, handling user input, and performing basic calculations with critical thinking.

# Problems Covered

01. Input a number & dislay whether it is divisible 5 or not.
02. Input the age of a person & display whether he/she is a voter or not.
03. Input the age of a person & display whether he/she is a teenager or not.
04. Input a number & display wheter that is perfect square or not.
05. Input three numbers & display the difference between the highest and the lowest number.
06. Write a C program to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its gross salary according to following:\n
      Basic Salary <=10000 : HRA = 20% , DA = 80%
      Basic Salary <=20000 : HRA = 25% , DA = 90%
      Basic Salary >20000 : HRA = 30% , DA = 95%
07. Write a C program which can input two numbers indicating a point in a 2D co-ordinate and determine its quardrant.
08. Write a C program to check whether the triangle is equilateral,isosceles or scalene triangle.
09. Write a C program to input all sides of a triangle and check whether triangle is valid or not.
10. Write a C program to input angles of a triangle and check whether triangle is valid or not.
11. Write a C program to input a number indicating income of a person and calculate tax with the given following conditions:
      if income is less than 150000 then no tax.
      if taxable income is in the range 150001-300000 then charge 10% tax.
      if taxable income is in the range 300001-500000 then charge 20% tax.
      if taxable income is above 500001 then charge 30% tax.
